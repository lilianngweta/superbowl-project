    "## 1. TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game\n",
    "<p>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14\">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62\">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>\n",
    "<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>\n",
    "<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>\n",
    "<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",

    "<p>The dataset we'll use was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\">scraped</a> and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions\">game data</a>, one with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings\">TV data</a>, and one with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows\">halftime musician data</a> for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018. Let's take a look, using <code>display()</code> instead of <code>print()</code> since its output is much prettier in Jupyter Notebooks.</p>"

Poor Scott. The biggest point discrepancy ever was 45 points (!) where Hall of Famer Joe Montana's led the San Francisco 49ers to victory in 1990, one year before the closest game ever.</p>\n",

I'm pretty sure we changed the channel at the end of the third quarter. Let's combine our game data and TV to see if this is a universal phenomenon. Do large point differences translate to lost viewers? We can plot <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings\">household share</a> <em>(average percentage of U.S. households with a TV in use that were watching for the entire broadcast)</em> vs. point difference to find out.</p>"

    "<p>So most non-band musicians do 1-3 songs per halftime show. It's important to note that the duration of the halftime show is fixed (roughly 12 minutes) so songs per performance is more a measure of how many hit songs you have. JT went off in 2018, wow. 11 songs! Diana Ross comes in second with 10 in her medley in 1996.</p>\n",

We visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. We used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And we discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.</p>\n",
